// Instead of a regular class, we are using a record for DTO.
// This specific record type is known as a Positional record.
// A Record type provides us an easier way to create an
// immutable reference type in .NET. This means that the
// Recordâ€™s instance property values cannot change after it's
// initialization. The data are passed by value and the
// equality between two Records is verified by comparing the
// value of their properties.
// Records can be a valid alternative to classes when we have
// to send or receive data. The very purpose of a DTO is to
// transfer data from one part of the code to another, and
// immutability in many cases is useful.
// We use them to return data from a Web API or to represent
// events in our application.
